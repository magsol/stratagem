# Stratagem

RTS for the ages.

## Overview

This was the final project for my CS 2335 Software Practicum course at Georgia Tech in the fall of 2004. The assignment was to create a networked, multiplayer, real-time strategy game in Java within six weeks. 

There were 100 points possible for this assignment (which, in turn, was worth 20% of our final grade), in addition to the possibility of 50 extra credit points for various nonessential features: map editors, instant messaging, OpenGL / 3D graphics engines, and so on. My team, with only three people (including myself), scored 148.5 out of 100 for fulfilling the core functionality and implementing several extras.

Unfortunately, other than needing Ant to build the project, I don't recall how to run it, so best of luck!
